Python Variable Annotations
Explanation and examples regarding variable annotations in Python.

Type-annotated Function - Add
A type-annotated function add that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

Type-annotated Function - Concat
A type-annotated function concat that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenation.

Type-annotated Function - Floor
A type-annotated function floor that takes a float argument and returns its floor value as an integer.

Type-annotated Function - to_str
A type-annotated function to_str that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

Type-annotated Function - Sum List
A type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

Type-annotated Function - Sum Mixed List
A type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

Type-annotated Function - to_kv
A type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string key and an int or float value as arguments and returns a tuple with the string key and the squared value.

Type-annotated Function - Make Multiplier
A type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as an argument and returns a function that can multiply a float by the multiplier.

Type Annotations - Element Length
A function element_length that calculates the length of elements in a list and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the element and its length. The function is annotated with appropriate type annotations.

Duck-typed Annotations - Safe First Element
A function safe_first_element that returns the first element of a given list if it exists, otherwise returns None. The function is annotated with appropriate duck-typed annotations.

Type Annotations - Safely Get Value
A function safely_get_value that retrieves a value from a dictionary based on a given key. It returns the value if the key exists in the dictionary, otherwise returns a default value. The function is annotated with appropriate type annotations.
