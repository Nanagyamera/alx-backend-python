ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON

This repository provides examples and explanations of asynchronous programming with Python. It covers various concepts and techniques, including async and await syntax, coroutines, event loops, and the asyncio module.

Task-based Asynchronous Functions

Introduction to Basic Async Syntax

The file basic_async_syntax.py introduces the basic syntax and concepts of asynchronous programming. It includes:

wait_random(max_delay): An asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay seconds and eventually returns it.

Spawning Tasks with Concurrency

The file concurrent_execution.py demonstrates spawning tasks with concurrency using the asyncio module. It includes:

wait_n(n, max_delay): An async routine that spawns wait_random n times with the specified max_delay. It returns a list of delays in ascending order.

task_wait_random(max_delay): A regular function that takes an integer max_delay and returns an asyncio.Task object.

task_wait_n(n, max_delay): An asynchronous function that spawns concurrent tasks using task_wait_random and returns delays in ascending order.

Measuring Execution Time

The file 2-measure_runtime.py includes a function for measuring the execution time of the tasks:

measure_time(n, max_delay): A regular function that measures the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay) and returns the average time per iteration.
Getting Started
To use these examples, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Nanagyamera/alx-backend-python.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install asyncio
Import the desired functions or modules into your Python script.
Use the functions as demonstrated in the examples provided.
Feel free to explore the files and modify the code to suit your specific use cases.
